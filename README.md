# Band-of-the-Bold
Hópverkefni: Ingólfur, Ólafur og Sæþór

This project is about a non-existent government program that we totally made up called the Ministry of the bold.
What we have is a server of about 100 users, and various group policy restrictions, which the ministry uses to enact its activites, such as funding people suffering from bouts of "running bold" as they call it. They also help people who are "dying of laughter from witnessing those bold men running." which is becoming much more common in north-america.
